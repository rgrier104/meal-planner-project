# Whole Foods, Plant-Based Meal Planner

The Whole Food, Plant-Based Meal Planner App allows you to add recipes you like to the database along with the link to the corresponding blog recipe. You can then plan out your weekly meals by adding a recipe from the database to each day, so the recipe and URL are right there whenever you need them. There is also a notes section where you can write down any ingredients you might need or information on what items need to be prepped ahead of time.

Open the index.html file in the meal-planner-frontend folder in your browser to start meal planning!
